## Explain "hoisting" {#Explain-hoisting}

Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope.
Note that the declaration is not actually moved - the JavaScript engine parses the declarations during compilation and becomes aware of declarations and their scopes.

```
console.log(foo); // undefined
var foo = 1;
console.log(foo); // 1
```

Function declarations have the body hoisted while the function expressions only has the variable declaration hoisted.

```
// Function Declaration
console.log(foo); // [Function: foo]
foo(); // 'FOOOOO'
function foo() {
  console.log('FOOOOO');
}
console.log(foo); // [Function: foo]

// Function Expression
console.log(bar); // undefined
bar(); // Uncaught TypeError: bar is not a function
var bar = function () {
  console.log('BARRRR');
};
console.log(bar); // [Function: bar]
```

Variables defined with let and const are hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.Meaning that the block of code is aware of the variable, but it cannot be used until it has been declared.

## What is a closure {#What-is-a-closure}

JavaScript implements a scoping mechanism named lexical scoping (or static scoping). Lexical scoping means that the accessibility of variables is determined by the position of the variables inside the nested scopes.

Simpler, the lexical scoping means that inside the inner scope you can access variables of outer scopes.

**Closures are functions that have access to the outer (enclosing) function's variables scope even after the outer function has returned.**

```
function outerFunc() {
  let outerVar = 'I am outside!';
  function innerFunc() {
    console.log(outerVar); // => logs "I am outside!"
  }
  return innerFunc;
}
function exec() {
  const myInnerFunc = outerFunc();
  myInnerFunc();
}
exec();
```

Now innerFunc() is executed outside of its lexical scope, but exactly in the scope of exec() function. And what's important:
innerFunc() still has access to outerVar from its lexical scope, even being executed outside of its lexical scope.

## JavaScript Rest vs Spread Operator {#JavaScript-Rest-vs-Spread-Operator}

### Rest Operator {#Rest-Operator}

**The rest operator (...) is used to put the rest of some specific user-supplied values into a JavaScript array.**

For instance, consider this code that uses rest to enclose some values into an array:

```
// Use rest to enclose the rest of specific user-supplied values into an array:
function myBio(firstName, lastName, ...otherInfo) {
  return otherInfo;
}

// Invoke myBio function while passing five arguments to its parameters:
myBio("Oluwatobi", "Sofela", "CodeSweetly", "Web Developer", "Male");

// The invocation above will return:
["CodeSweetly", "Web Developer", "Male"]
```

### Spread Operator {#Spread-Operator}

**The spread operator (...) helps you expand iterables into individual elements.**
A spread operator is effective only when used within array literals, function calls, or initialized properties objects.

### Example 1: How Spread Works in an Array Literal

```
const myName = ["Sofela", "is", "my"];
const aboutMe = ["Oluwatobi", ...myName, "name."];

console.log(aboutMe);

// The invocation above will return:
[ "Oluwatobi", "Sofela", "is", "my", "name." ]
```

Suppose we did not use the spread syntax to duplicate myName’s content. For instance, if we had written const aboutMe = ["Oluwatobi", myName, "name."]. In such a case, the computer would have assigned a reference back to myName

### Example 2: How to Use Spread to Convert a String into Individual Array Items

```
const myName = "Oluwatobi Sofela";

console.log([...myName]);

// The invocation above will return:
[ "O", "l", "u", "w", "a", "t", "o", "b", "i", " ", "S", "o", "f", "e", "l", "a" ]
```

### Example 3: How the Spread Operator Works in a Function Call

```
const numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7];

function addNumbers(a, b, c, d) {
  return a + b + c + d;
}

console.log(addNumbers(...numbers));

// The invocation above will return:
16
```

Suppose the numbers array had more than four items. In such a case, the computer will only use the first four items as addNumbers() argument and ignore the rest.

```
const numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 200, 90, 59];

function addNumbers(a, b, c, d) {
  return a + b + c + d;
}

console.log(addNumbers(...numbers));

// The invocation above will return:
16
```

### Example 4: How Spread Works in an Object Literal

```
const myNames = ["Oluwatobi", "Sofela"];
const bio = { ...myNames, runs: "codesweetly.com" };

console.log(bio);

// The invocation above will return:

{ 0: "Oluwatobi", 1: "Sofela", runs: "codesweetly.com" }
```

- Spread operators can’t expand object literal’s values
- Since a properties object is not an iterable object, you cannot use the spread operator to expand its values.
- However, you can use the spread operator to clone properties from one object into another.

```
const myName = { firstName: "Oluwatobi", lastName: "Sofela" };
const bio = { ...myName, website: "codesweetly.com" };

console.log(bio);

// The invocation above will return:
{ firstName: "Oluwatobi", lastName: "Sofela", website: "codesweetly.com" };
```
