## Global vs Local Scope {#Global-vs-Local-Scope}

In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility of variables. Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope. This means, they can be seen everywhere in your JavaScript code.
Variables which are declared without the let or const keywords are automatically created in the global scope.
const myGlobal = 10;
function fun1() {
// Assign 5 to oopsGlobal Here
oopsGlobal = 5;

}

// Only change code above this line

function fun2() {
var output = "";
if (typeof myGlobal != "undefined") {
output += "myGlobal: " + myGlobal;
}
if (typeof oopsGlobal != "undefined") {
output += " oopsGlobal: " + oopsGlobal;
}
console.log(output);
}

Variables which are declared within a function, as well as the function parameters, have local scope. That means they are only visible within that function.

function myLocalScope() {
// Only change code below this line
let myVar
console.log('inside myLocalScope', myVar);
}
myLocalScope();

// Run and check the console
// myVar is not defined outside of myLocalScope
console.log('outside myLocalScope', myVar);

It is possible to have both local and global variables with the same name. When you do this, the local variable takes precedence over the global variable.

In this example:

const someVar = "Hat";

function myFun() {
const someVar = "Head";
return someVar;
}
The function myFun will return the string Head because the local version of the variable is present.

## Escape Sequences in Strings {#Escape-Sequences-in-Strings}

The parseInt() function parses a string and returns an integer. It takes a second argument for the radix, which specifies the base of the number in the string. The radix can be an integer between 2 and 36.

The function call looks like:

parseInt(string, radix);
And here's an example:

const a = parseInt("11", 2);
The radix variable says that 11 is in the binary system, or base 2. This example converts the string 11 to an integer 3.

As seen in the previous challenge, const declaration alone doesn't really protect your data from mutation. To ensure your data doesn't change, JavaScript provides a function Object.freeze to prevent data mutation.

Any attempt at changing the object will be rejected, with an error thrown if the script is running in strict mode.

let obj = {
name:"FreeCodeCamp",
review:"Awesome"
};
Object.freeze(obj);
obj.review = "bad";
obj.newProp = "Test";
console.log(obj);
The obj.review and obj.newProp assignments will result in errors, because our editor runs in strict mode by default, and the console will display the value { name: "FreeCodeCamp", review: "Awesome" }.

Use the Rest Parameter with Function Parameters
In order to help us create more flexible functions, ES6 introduces the rest parameter for function parameters. With the rest parameter, you can create functions that take a variable number of arguments. These arguments are stored in an array that can be accessed later from inside the function.

Check out this code:

function howMany(...args) {
return "You have passed " + args.length + " arguments.";
}
console.log(howMany(0, 1, 2));
console.log(howMany("string", null, [1, 2, 3], { }));
The console would display the strings You have passed 3 arguments. and You have passed 4 arguments..

Use the Spread Operator to Evaluate Arrays In-Place
ES6 introduces the spread operator, which allows us to expand arrays and other expressions in places where multiple parameters or elements are expected.

The ES5 code below uses apply() to compute the maximum value in an array:

var arr = [6, 89, 3, 45];
var maximus = Math.max.apply(null, arr);
maximus would have a value of 89.

We had to use Math.max.apply(null, arr) because Math.max(arr) returns NaN. Math.max() expects comma-separated arguments, but not an array. The spread operator makes this syntax much better to read and maintain.

const arr = [6, 89, 3, 45];
const maximus = Math.max(...arr);
maximus would have a value of 89.

...arr returns an unpacked array. In other words, it spreads the array. However, the spread operator only works in-place, like in an argument to a function or in an array literal. The following code will not work:

Use Destructuring Assignment to Extract Values from ObjectsPassed
Destructuring assignment is special syntax introduced in ES6, for neatly assigning values taken directly from an object.

Consider the following ES5 code:

const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 34 };

const name = user.name;
const age = user.age;
name would have a value of the string John Doe, and age would have the number 34.

Here's an equivalent assignment statement using the ES6 destructuring syntax:

const { name, age } = user;
Again, name would have a value of the string John Doe, and age would have the number 34.

Here, the name and age variables will be created and assigned the values of their respective values from the user object. You can see how much cleaner this is.

You can extract as many or few values from the object as you want.

Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from ObjectsPassed
Destructuring allows you to assign a new variable name when extracting values. You can do this by putting the new name after a colon when assigning the value.

Using the same object from the last example:

const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 34 };
Here's how you can give new variable names in the assignment:

const { name: userName, age: userAge } = user;
You may read it as "get the value of user.name and assign it to a new variable named userName" and so on. The value of userName would be the string John Doe, and the value of userAge would be the number 34.

Replace the two assignments with an equivalent destructuring assignment. It should still assign the variables highToday and highTomorrow the values of today and tomorrow from the HIGH_TEMPERATURES object.

Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Nested Objects
You can use the same principles from the previous two lessons to destructure values from nested objects.

Using an object similar to previous examples:

const user = {
johnDoe: {
age: 34,
email: 'johnDoe@freeCodeCamp.com'
}
};
Here's how to extract the values of object properties and assign them to variables with the same name:

const { johnDoe: { age, email }} = user;
And here's how you can assign an object properties' values to variables with different names:

const { johnDoe: { age: userAge, email: userEmail }} = user;
Replace the two assignments with an equivalent destructuring assignment. It should still assign the variables lowToday and highToday the values of today.low and today.high from the LOCAL_FORECAST object.

Use class Syntax to Define a Constructor Function
The class syntax simply replaces the constructor function creation:

class SpaceShuttle {
constructor(targetPlanet) {
this.targetPlanet = targetPlanet;
}
}
const zeus = new SpaceShuttle('Jupiter');
It should be noted that the class keyword declares a new function, to which a constructor is added. This constructor is invoked when new is called to create a new object.

Note: UpperCamelCase should be used by convention for ES6 class names, as in SpaceShuttle used above.

The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class. You will learn more about it in the Object Oriented Programming section of the JavaScript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification.

You can obtain values from an object and set the value of a property within an object.
These are classically called getters and setters.

Getter functions are meant to simply return (get) the value of an object's private variable to the user without the user directly accessing the private variable.

Setter functions are meant to modify (set) the value of an object's private variable based on the value passed into the setter function. This change could involve calculations, or even overwriting the previous value completely.

class Book {
constructor(author) {
this.\_author = author;
}
// getter
get writer() {
return this.\_author;
}
// setter
set writer(updatedAuthor) {
this.\_author = updatedAuthor;
}
}
const novel = new Book('anonymous');
console.log(novel.writer);
novel.writer = 'newAuthor';
console.log(novel.writer);
The console would display the strings anonymous and newAuthor.

Notice the syntax used to invoke the getter and setter. They do not even look like functions. Getters and setters are important because they hide internal implementation details.

Note: It is convention to precede the name of a private variable with an underscore (\_). However, the practice itself does not make a variable private.

Create an Export Fallback with export default
In the export lesson, you learned about the syntax referred to as a named export. This allowed you to make multiple functions and variables available for use in other files.

There is another export syntax you need to know, known as export default. Usually you will use this syntax if only one value is being exported from a file. It is also used to create a fallback value for a file or module.

What's the difference between an "attribute" and a "property"?
Attributes are defined on the HTML markup but properties are defined on the DOM. To illustrate the difference, imagine we have this text field in our HTML:
`<input type="text" value="Hello">.`

const input = document.querySelector('input');
console.log(input.getAttribute('value')); // Hello
console.log(input.value); // Hello
But after you change the value of the text field by adding "World!" to it, this becomes:

console.log(input.getAttribute('value')); // Hello
console.log(input.value); // Hello World!
